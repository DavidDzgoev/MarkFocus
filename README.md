## FAQ

- **Code formatting**: If prettier does not work, check out the VSCode setting

  - Code -> Preferences -> Settings -> Search "Default Formatter" -> Choose Prettier

  - Make sure you have checked the on save formatting option

  - Notes: If the .editorconfig file exists in the root directory of the project folder, VSCode will ignore the default editor settings, and use the .editorconfig settings.
